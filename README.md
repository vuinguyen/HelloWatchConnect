# HelloWatchConnect

### App Description:
This app demonstrates how a watch and an iPhone app can communicate with one another using the WatchConnectivity framework. Both the watch and iPhone need to be in a "reachable" state in order for the iPhone to send a message to the watch.

Here, we have a very simple example of the watch "logging in" to the watch app when the iPhone sends a not so secure example of a password to the watch.  

The iPhone can also have the watch "log out" by sending a "log out" message to the watch.
